#Name
Tkinter Calculators

#Description
These scripts (each one by itself) run two similar calculor programs, both created with python3 with the library "Tkinter"
The differences are:
 - In "CalculatorTkinter" the calculator has been made without using the function "eval()" of python, what means that has been made in a more logical way.
 - In "CalculatorTkinter2" the calculator uses the function "eval()" making the operations easier to follow and making the creation easier too.

#Motivation
My motivation to make this project was to learn how Tkinter works, and start having the habit of periodically create one or several projects. 

#Learnt
What I learnt with this project was to start using this Class usage in python, and the logic of Python GUIs (or at least Tkinter).
